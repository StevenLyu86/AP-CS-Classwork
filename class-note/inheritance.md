Inheritance: Inheritance defines a relationship between objects that share characteristics.
Superclass: A class from which other classes are derived
Subclass: A modular, derivative class that inherits one or more language entities from one or more other classes.
extends: The inheritance relationship between a subclass and a superclass is specified in the declaration of the subclass, using the keyword extends.
super(): A subclass constructor can be implemented with a call to the super method, which invokes the superclass constructor.

The subclass inherits characteristics of its superclass. It was creating from a superclass by absorbing its state and behavior and augmenting these with features unique to the subclass.

A subclass is bigger than a superclass.
